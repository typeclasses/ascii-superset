This package defines classes which describe what subset of a type is valid as
ASCII, as well as a type constructor representing a value of a superset that is
known to be valid ASCII.

It also defines the `Lift` class, which provides a polymorphic lift operation
that can be used to convert characters and strings into types that support a
larger set of characters.
